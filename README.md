_The Dataset_

The data used for this assignment is from the World Health Organization, where they are keeping track
of Covid-19 vaccinations in the US. The Data is organized by State, County, Doses (1 and 2) for the 
original vaccinations, in addition to boosters. They also included age groups, although it wasnt 
broken down in the best way, for this assignment. The data set is very large, and originally contained multiple
days in which they recorded, however it was too large to work with, so the data set was cut to only contain
1 day's worth of information.


_shiny website_

 In the website, there are three tabs.
 
 
 
 
* **The introduction**; introducing the data and where it is from. It also contains a sample of the dateset.
              it is very long due to the numbe of variables so you need to scroll very far.
             
             
             
             
             
* **The Plot**; this tab is displaying a bar graph, utilizing radio buttons to 
              select the color the user would want the bar graph to be in. Also check boxes
              with all 50 States so that they can select which they would like to see. The bar graph shows 
              how many individuals per state have competed the original series of covid-19 vaccines. 
              Lastly, at the bottom of the graph, you can see the text summary that changes with what 
              States are selected in sidebar.
            
              
              
* **The Table**; within this tab there is a data table displaying the age groups of the
              individuals who have completed the original series of covid-19 vaccinations.
              Users are able to adjust using side bar radio buttons to select which age group 
              specifically they want to look at. The table is organized by State, going in alphabetical 
              order, and in the next column we can see the County in which the data applies to. Lastly, 
              in the last column we are given the number of individuals who have completed their shots. 
              Above the table, there is a text summary that dispays what agegroup the user has selected.
